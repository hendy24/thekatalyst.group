            <h3 class="text-center">What Does Partnering With Us Mean?</h3>
            <p class="text-justify">The Katalyst Group is not a listing service—we’re your sales and marketing partner. We operate as an extension of your team, focused on moving homes, building your brand, and driving the success of your community. Every engagement starts with a deep dive into your goals, followed by a customized marketing strategy grounded in local market research. We review this plan quarterly to adapt to changing conditions and maximize results. With nearly 20 years of experience in custom home construction, we understand what it takes to bring a home to market—and we close the gap between building and selling to help your projects thrive.</p>
            <p>We’re also rethinking how real estate services are paid for—eliminating bloated commissions in favor of a model that creates real savings and stronger alignment. When you save money on sales, you have more to reinvest in future communities—meaning more homes for us to market and sell. Our goal isn’t to close one deal. It’s to become your long-term partner in growth.</p>
