                    The<span class="text-orange">Katalyst</span>.Group isn&#39;t just a listing service—we&#39;re your full-service sales and brand awareness partner. We operate as an extension of your team, focused on moving homes, building your brand, and driving community success.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every engagement begins with a deep dive into your goals and a custom strategy backed by local market research and knowledge. We revisit your plan quarterly to adapt to shifting market conditions and maximize results.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With nearly 20 years of experience in custom home construction, we understand what it takes to bring homes to market—and we close the gap between building and selling to help your projects thrive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We&#39;re also disrupting the traditional real estate fee model. By eliminating traditional commissions, we create meaningful savings and better alignment. When you keep more from each sale, you can reinvest in future communities—which means more homes for us to help market and sell.
                </p>
                <p class="fw-semibold mb-5">
                    Our goal isn&#39;t just to close deals. It&#39;s to become your long-term growth partner.
