                <p>
                The traditional real estate commission model is outdated — especially for builders. It makes sense for a builder to earn a percentage of the cost of a home: you take the risk, spend months building, manage crews, and invest your own capital.
                </p>
                <p>
                But for real estate agents? It doesn’t add up. It doesn’t take any more time or skill to sell a $5M home than a $500K one — yet the pay is wildly different.
                </p>
                <p class="fw-semibold text-orange">That’s broken. And we’ve lived it.</p>

                <p>
                In 2008, I had homes I’d spent six months building. The market crashed, I sold at a loss, and made nothing. But the Realtor? Still got paid.
                </p>
                <p><strong>That’s when I realized the system was broken.</strong></p>
                <p>Builders bear all the risk — agents keep getting paid. That didn’t sit right, and it became the foundation for everything we do now.</p>
